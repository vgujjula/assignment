Hi Patrick,

Here is the zip file with the implemented program for the given problem. Once you extract this file, it will create venkat_assignment folder. Please go to that folder, all the instructions are in README.txt file.

Note: Gmail is not allowing zip file as attachment from my side, so I named the file as "venkat_assignment". Please rename it to "venkat_assignment.zip" and extract it.

Please let me know if you get any issues. I am also attaching README.txt file here.
Tested it with java 1.8.

Thanks,
Venkat

Hi Patrick,

Just now I sent you an attachment with 4 MB file with assignment solution. In case you did not get it because of any email server limitations, please let me know.

Thanks,
Venkat

Hi Venkat,
 
I don’t see the 4mb attachment.
Any chance this is checked into github so I can take a look at it that way?
